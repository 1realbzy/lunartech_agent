   - Contains a human-readable summary of the interview
   - Includes key points from the candidate's responses
   - Lists structured information extracted from the interview

2. **JSON Data**: `summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
   - Contains all interview data in structured JSON format
   - Includes raw questions and answers
   - Includes the generated summary
   - Contains extracted information about the candidate:
     - Full name
     - Interest level (high/medium/low)
     - Readiness level (high/medium/low)
     - Background summary

These summary files can be used for:
